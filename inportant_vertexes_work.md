# Identifying Important Vertexes in Directed Weighted Networks
## --An Empirical Study of the Global ‘Brain Circulation’

**Abstract**
Method to identify the important vertexes in a directed weighted network has not been covered by a considerable quantity of literature yet. In this study, we proposed a dynamic perspective viewing a directed weighted network as a pattern of a Markov Process and developed a new approach in the identification of key vertexes. We then derived the global pattern of ‘brain circulation’ from 2000 to 2017 using data from the ORCID website, constructed a network containing 66 countries/territories and conducted an analyzation using our method. We found that 1) Sweden, Germany and Netherlands are the top three ‘important’ countries in this network and 2) the United State, China and other developed countries in the Western Europe were not identified as the most ‘important’. These results led us to rethink the evaluation of vertexes in a directed weighted network and to provide a new definition of an ‘important vertex’.<br>

_Identification of important vertexes in a network/graph_
A general network/graph is defined to contain both vertex(es)/node(s) and edge(s)/arc(s) (depite that some network do contain no edge) where the vertexes are linked by the edges (Thulasiraman & Swamy, 2011). A large quantity of literature have been produced on the evaluation of the vertexes in a network or graph (or the mining of important vertexes). There already are measurements such as degree centrality (Freeman, 1979), eigenvector centrality (Stephenson & Zelen, 1989), subgraph centrality (Estrada & Rodríguez-Velázquez, 2005), etc. But amongst these measurements, most are aimed at (or only suit) the analyzation of unweighted or undirected graph. If we simply apply these method to the directed or weighted graphs, valuable information is seemingly to be left out. For those aiming at directed and weighted graph, the literature has a significantly smaller size. One of the most famous method is the PageRank algorithm (Sehgal, Kaur & Kumar, 2009) first developed by Larry Page, a co-founder of Google. Besides, more researchers seek to evaluate the vertexes in a directed weighted network using mathematical models. A fraction of them introduced the Markov Chain into the analyzation of these networks and proposed a dynamic view of the position evaluation of vertexes. For example, Yun, Gang & Jun (2017) proposed a perspective viewing the network as a presentation of a Markov Process and redefined the importance of a vertex in a network. In more realistic contexts, some applied this kind of thinking and attempted to solve more practical problems such as charactering user mobility by using traces of WLANs (Lee & Hou, 2006), patterning community diffusion in mobile social networks (Ryu et al., 2017) or predicting user mobility of GPS users (Yu, Yu & Chen, 2015). Our study implemented Yun, Gang & Jun (2017) as viewing a network as a pattern for a Markov Process and proposed a new mothed for the identification of important vertexes. To conduct an empirical study using our method, we chose the network of the global flows of scientists (so-called ‘brain circulation’) as our research object and analyzed the major countries/territories getting involved.<br>
_Brain circulation_<br>
‘Brain circulation’ is a recent theory used to describe the collective scientific mobility (Chen & Koyama, 2013; Daugeliene and Marcinkeviciene, 2015; Sugimoto et al., 2017). Sugimoto et al. (2017) used the term ‘traveler’ to refer to what used to be called scientific migrants because nowadays, in more cases, they only ‘stop by’ rather than ‘settle down’ after moving to a new place. As they ‘travel’ across country borders, their connections with former institutions, cities and countries do not diminish but instead, are integrated into their ‘social capital’ (Meyer, 2003). From the perspective of social capital, the networks constructed by human relationships lowers the risks and elevates the expected return of the movements (Boyd, 1989), and thus the mobility is facilitated. The return migration (Ley & Kobayashi, 2005) of scientists contributed to the brain circulation as a major flow. On the national level, those that influence the decisions on whether to return include the economics, politics, policies, research environment and even the natural environment (Zweig, 1997; Cao, 2008; Teo, 2011; Jonkers, 2008); and on the individual level, the strength of incentives varies across ages, gender, lifestyles, etc.( Zweig, 1997; Cao, 2008; Teo, 2011)<br>
Technically, tracking scientific mobility itself has been a detached research focus with embedded literature. The data used in existing studies mainly came from curricula vitae (CVs) collected from multiple sources (Laudel, 2003; Moed & Halevi, 2014), bibliometric records (Laudel, 2005; Moed, Aisati & Plume, 2013; Dyachenko, 2017; Sugimoto et al., 2017), census data and visa information (Beine, Docquier & Oden-Defoort, 2011; Orazbayev, 2016) surveys (Cruz-Castro & Sanz-Menéndez, 2010; Equeter & Hellemans, 2016) and other publicly available information such as official report from governments or non-governmental organizations (Jonkers, 2008; Gaulé, 2014), candidate profiles of certain conferences or programs(Zweig & Wang, 2013), etc. There are limitations and potential biases when using of each of these previous methods. Take Moed, Aisati & Plume (2013) as an example, in their study using mere bibliometric data, only active paper authors can be detected as movers. Since the residence of a scholar in a certain place is inferred from the author addresses, this method cannot guarantee ‘high resolution’ for the flowing pattern it draws, considering the uncertainty of when the mobility actually took place. Besides, these studies suffer badly from the problem of name ambiguation, especially for those involving Chinese scholars (Tang & Walsh, 2010). Moed & Halevi (2014) proposed a method by introducing academic CVs and data collected through questionnaires into the dataset, alleviating the misconceptions resulted by merely using bibliometric records. However, in general, either the accuracy of the data or the volume of the dataset must be sacrificed for the feasibility of their studies.<br>
One novelty of this study lies in the use of data from ORCID website (www.orcid.org) to pattern the global brain circulation. The ORCID, i.e., Open Researcher and Contributor ID, is a non-proprietary alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies authors and contributors in scientific literature. Each registrant has a web page displaying his/her academic CV on www.orcid.org. By the end of 2017, there are ~0.75 million scientists from all over the world with available CVs on the web pages, and their academic experience dates back to the year of 1913. Therefore, data from the ORCID website features both large quantity (~0.75 CVs) and high accuracy (information provided by the registrants themselves).<br>
